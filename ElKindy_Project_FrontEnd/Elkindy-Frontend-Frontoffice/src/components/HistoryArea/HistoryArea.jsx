                  Since 1999, Conservatoire El Kindy has nurtured generations of musical artists through rich and demanding education, guided by the expertise and dedication of our team of seasoned specialists and professors. Over the years, our institution has continuously supported and guided aspiring artists. Our conservatory students have excelled in national competitions such as the amateur soloists of Megrine and the NÃ©apolis music days, among others. Their educational journey often culminates in the attainment of the Arab music diploma recognized by the Tunisian Ministry of Culture.
